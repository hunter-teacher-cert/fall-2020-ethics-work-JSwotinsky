Term Project Shortlist:

#1: Digital Divide: 
-As the Time article points out, "Less than half of households living on under $20,000 are connected. The collective deficit in opportunity, education and prospects–everything implied in “being connected”–further separates us into haves and have-nots."...How does this relate to the experiences of our own students?
-Another relevant point from the Time article: “Universal telephone service has been around for a hundred years, maybe more. It’s a well-established social principle that everybody ought to have the ability to communicate”
-Should high-speed internet, modern devices, etc. be considered premium or have they now become basic neccessities? Remote learning has brought this question to the center of the spotlight.

#2: Security vs. Convenience:
-In highlighting the balance between security and convenience, the PCWorld article uses the example of account passwords, noting "Strong password security causes almost as many problems as it solves. Everyone knows they’re not supposed to use the word “password”, or the name of their pet as their password. But, creating long passwords comprised of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters means they’re also harder to remember."...Some solutions already exist, such as password management software.  What other software solutions could be developed to mitigate the inconvenience that comes along with increased security?

#3: Environment:
-The DCD article points out, that "about five percent of total global energy usage is by electronics. That number is projected to grow to at least 40 percent by 2030..."  That is a sobering statistic.
-The current trend for many consumer electronics is a short life span.  They are built with exciting new features, but not made to last.  In some cases, a new device becomes obsolete within a couple of years.  Might there be a software solution that would allow consumers to continue upgrading to the "latest and greatest" without requiring the manufacture of a new product, thereby reducing the negative environmental effects associated with mass manufacturing?
